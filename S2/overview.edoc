@title Muty: a distributed mutual-exclusion lock

@doc Muty is a distributed mutual-exclusion lock. The lock use a multicast
strategy and work in an asynchronous network where we do not have access to a
synchronized clock. Implemented in three versions: the deadlock prone,
the unfair, and the Lamport clocked. Based in the Ricart and Agrawala mutual
exclusion algorithm.
